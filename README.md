Pixel Plunge is a deep sea fishing game, where the aim is to catch as many fish as possible before the oxygen runs out!
<br>
Users can upgrade equipment to extend their dive times, and also check what fish they have caught and what fish they are missing!
<br>
Give it a try and see if you can top the leaderboard!
